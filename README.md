You are about to read a great fighter's story. **#Forged with a will to achieve #I'm born ready**

I was born and brought in a small town in Southern India. With a great motivation from my parents, I topped my school examinations and planned to head college. --**Worthy Mention:** I had a perfect score in Science and Mathematics-- 

So, what would be the first option for a small town kid to plan for his future, who has never came across internet or smartphone?
It's experiences and advices of the elderly and educated.

After a lot of informative discussions, I have decided to pursue AIEEE. For those who don't know it, It's second most valued National Level Entrance Exam for Undergraduate Studies in India. But, after heading to the college, destiny wanted me to explore something else more complex and interesting i.e. IIT-JEE. Top ranked examination in India, holds a top 10 position across World.  

I was able to crack it with a great will to succeed and support from my mentors and friends. I was very glad to clear the exam but that ecstasy didn't last long. **Why ?**

Here comes the reason, I did not know which course to choose to pursue my bachelors. I had no one in my family to discuss about what would better align to my interests. _I'm the first engineer in my family from both maternal and paternal side_ 

With my interest in Mathematics, coupled with advices from my dad's colleagues, I decided to pursue Electronics & Communications Engineering with focus on Analog Communications.

IIT(ISM) Dhanbad has provided a great stage to explore new opportunities and foster my development professionally and personally. During my course of studies, I realised that I had passion towards teaching and I am adept in explaining things with real time examples.

I followed my heart and started full time job as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at FIITJEE Ltd, Kochi. As it was a fairly new office, I took additional responsibilty of buiding reports and monitoring student progress as BI Analyst.
